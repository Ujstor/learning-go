# Constants

Constants are declared like variables but use the `const` keyword. Constants can't use the `:=` short declaration syntax.

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values. They *can not* be more complex types like slices, maps and structs, which are types we will explain later.

As the name implies, the value of a constant can't be changed after it has been declared.
