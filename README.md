## Getting Started

If you're new to Go, you've come to the right place. Follow these steps to start your Go journey:

1. **Installation**: To get started, you need to install Go on your machine. Visit the official [Go Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) for instructions on how to set up Go on your platform.

2. **Hello World**: Create your first Go program by following the classic "Hello, World!" example. You can use a simple text editor or a Go-specific IDE like Visual Studio Code with the Go extension.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

3. **Learning Resources**: Explore the [Resources](#resources) section for a list of books, tutorials, and online courses to enhance your Go knowledge.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Go, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of programming concepts. Knowledge of any programming language, such as C, Java, or Python, will be advantageous but not mandatory.
